# Eye Movement Excercise

<img src= "https://github.com/jessica-medley/eye-movement/blob/main/eyemovementscreenshot.png" width='300'/>

## Description:
These eyes will follow your mouse movement on the page. I added a second eye so both eyes will watch the mouse move.

## How to Run: 
Simply copy the files into one folder on your computer, then open the html file in a browser. You could also drag the html file over to the browser. Once the page loads, move you mouse around on the page to see the eyes move.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Add function so if the mouse clicks once one eye winks.
